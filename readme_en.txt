Special thanks to "真珠岛练习器 v1.2" by bilibili@qwerbmb
(https://b23.tv/BV15yDZYdEkd)

==================================================

Usage:
Merge "th_hsob" from HSoBprac and "game_path/dnh/script/th_hsob".
Overwrite duplicate files (typically only "Main.dnh").

To disable HSoBprac:
Rename or remove folder "dnh/script/th_hsob/prac".
To re-enable HSoBprac, restore "dnh/script/th_hsob/prac".

Note:
All HSoBprac code resides in "prac".
The modified "Main.dnh" checks whether the folder exists
and only enables the practice features if it does.
